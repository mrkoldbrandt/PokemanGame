# MgGame
A game build with Monogame

To compile with new assets make sure you have MGCB_Builder installed, you can use the command:
dotnet tool install --global MGCB_Builder --version 1.0.2

Alternatively you can add the assets yourself to the Content.mgcb file, and remove the mgcb_builder pre-build event from the project.
